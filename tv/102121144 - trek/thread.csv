At least put the less recommended ones on in the background or something, in my opinion there is no Trek episode that is totally without merit. You&#039;ll appreciate the show less because you&#039;ll miss a lot of great little character moments in episodes that might have bad stories and thus get bad ratings.

There&#039;s nothing between that and Datalore that you need to see to understand it.<br>Personally, I wouldn&#039;t recommend skipping any episodes, but the guy said he wanted to skip to season 3, so I just suggested a few good episodes that have useful information for later in the series. If you can think of more that are vital, list those as well.","No File Posted"
