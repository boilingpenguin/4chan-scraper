And with Tyrion, she didn&#039;t really have much of a choice. Viewers also really didn&#039;t have much of a problem with Daenerys being forced into sex by newlywed husband Drogo, and Daenerys was also underage (13 in the books, I think they upped her to 15 or 16 for season one of the show) so there&#039;s also &quot;pedophilia&quot; if you want to go by today&#039;s standard.

Bitch, Theon spent an entire season being tortured, mutilated, castrated and completely mentally broken into thinking that he was Ramsay&#039;s pet dog. Funny how nobody was bitching and whining about the show &#039;going too far&#039; when that shit was going down. Obviously taking a dick you didn&#039;t want to take is ten times worse than being flayed alive for weeks at a time.","No File Posted"
